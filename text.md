## W1D1
- The Internet (A connection of computer networks using the Internet Protocol (IP))
- DNS (A set of servers that map written names to IP addresses)
- HTML5 New Semantic Elements (header, footer, nav, article, section, aside)

## W1D2
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) (A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language)
- Sepcificity and Conflicts 
- Calculating Specificity (Tag: 1, Class: 10, ID: 100)
- CSS Box Model (Content, Padding, Border, Margin)

## W1D3 - CSS for Page Layout
- The box model is a description of how every element has a basic width and height, outside of which it has padding, a border, and margin. For inline elements only the left and right margin and padding affect surrounding elements
- Positioning (static, relative, absolute, fixed)
- Visible vs Display None: Visible elements take up space, while elements with display none do not

## W1D4 - HTML Forms
- Responsive design is the strategy of making a website that works on all devices
- Flexbox is a layout mode that allows elements to align and distribute space within a container
- Forms are used to collect user input
- Form elements include input, textarea, select, and button
- Grid vs Flexbox: Grid is for 2D layouts, Flexbox is for 1D layouts

## W1D5 - JavaScript for Modern Web Apps
- Block scoped variables are declared using let and const
- Best practices: Always use const unless you know you will reassign the variable
- Number Type: integers and real numbers are the same type (no int vs. double)
- Logical Operators: most logical operators automatically convert types.
- JavaScript code runs when the page loads it. Event handlers cannot be assigned until the target elements are loaded. In intelligent systems certain events must happen in a particular order. Creative intelligence proceeds in an orderly sequential manner.

## W1D6 - JavaScript Programming Env
- JavaScript has a set of global DOM objects
accessible to every web page. Every JavaScript
object runs inside the global window object. The
window object has many global functions such
as alert and timer methods. 
- JavaScript Timers: know how to use setTimeout and setInterval
- Unit Testing: Unit testing is an industry wide best practice that ensures code quality and maintainability (know how to use Mocha and Chai)

## W2D1 - JavaScript Functional Programming
- Both Rest and Spread allow the programmer to treat multiple items as one
- No function overloading in JavaScript. Extra arguments ignored and missing ones ignored
- using "use strict" at the top of a file or function will enforce stricter parsing and error handling in JavaScript


## W2D2 - Scope, Closures, Encapsulation
- JavaScript has global scope and local scope within functions when variables are declared with var, and now has block scope with const and let.

- JavaScript has a 2-pass compiler that hoists all function and variable declarations.

- When we ask for any variable, JS will look for that variable in the current scope. If it doesn’t find it, it will consult its outer scope until we reach the global scope.

- Var vs Let: let is block scoped, var is function scoped

- Variable Hoisting: JavaScript hoists all variable and function declarations to the top of the current scope.

## W2D3 - Modules and Objects
- In JavaScript, like Java, the keyword ‘this’ refers to the containing object. However, in JavaScript the same ‘this’ can refer to many different types of objects depending on the context.

- this in side or outside of a function refers to the global object. In strict mode, this is undefined.

- Self Pattern: to resolve this issue we can use self = this or use arrow functions

## W2D4 - Inheritance and Prototypes
- Can create thousands of objects from function constructor with less memory space.
- Prototypes are a way to share methods between objects

### SCI
- When learning about Responsive design I think of:
The unified field is the source of all possibilities and possibilities we think from this level our actions are spontaneous
respond to every situation we encounter. We are always flexible and ready to handle all situations and challenges.
